Original code by [Eric White](https://github.com/EricWhiteDev)

only minor changes will be done (incomplete list):
- [ ] update 3rd party deps (JSzip,FileSaver.js)
- [ ] clean from obsolete/unnecessary files and restructure directories etc
- [ ] fix examples, which will not work due to restructuring
- [ ] evaluate some use cases -> probably more complex (xlsx) examples
- [ ] replace copy&paste code (from Masanao Izumo, 1999), which is published under the GPL (http://www.onicos.com/staff/iz/amuse/javascript/expert/)
- [ ] update ms deps (linq.js - v3.0.4-Beta5) ?
- [ ] probably remove flash dependant code (html5 is a buzzword, but I like it)
- [ ] add complete TODO list here ;)
